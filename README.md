# Taipei-YouBike-by-District
Draw a chart showing the proportion of the total number of YouBikes in each district of Taipei City and save it in the Excel workbook.    

Use Python to grab the json data of the YouBike site information, and then use the pandas package to access the information I need and convert it into table data.   
  
Use the matplotlib.pyplot package to draw a visual line graph to show the total number of districts, the ratio %, and the avaible amount to rent ratio %, and then use matplotlib.font_manager to adjust the font-related requirements, and finally use xlwings to store in Excel.   
  
Many basic concepts including the use of variables, List, Dictionary, and loop are used to complete this project.
